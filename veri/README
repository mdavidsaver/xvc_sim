Cross comparisons with OpenCores JTAG TAP

http://www.opencores.org/projects/jtag/

tap_top.v can not be synthesized.

It also does not completely conform to ieee 1149.1-2001
in that TDO changes one sim. tick after posedge tclk
instead of negedge tclk as mandated.  This can be worked
around by waiting >=2 sim ticks between tclk edges.
